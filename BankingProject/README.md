Project Summary: Banking Website Testing

I have undertaken this project to simulate a corporate testing environment, where I have tested a demo banking website. I have created and executed test cases online while comparing them with expert-prepared samples in real-time.

Through this project, I have:
âœ… Gained hands-on experience in professional software testing.
âœ… Identified bugs and enhanced my attention to detail.
âœ… Understood the workflow of a professional tester.
âœ… Improved my testing skills with real-time feedback and continuous learning.

This project has provided me with a corporate-like experience, refining my skills in test case creation, execution, and analysis. ðŸš€
